INSTALLING GOLDSTONE
*********************

Installing goldstone is a two step process:

1. Install goldstone packages
2. Direct OpenStack server logs to goldstone server

Before installing goldstone, your server needs to meet the following prerequesites:

* 4GB RAM
* x64 CPU
* 100 GB free disk space
* CentOS / RHEL 6.5

To view and use goldstone, you will need a recent version of the `Google Chrome browser`_.

.. _Google Chrome browser: https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/

RUN GOLDSTONE INSTALLER
***********************

First, enable the CentOS EPEL repositories and install some dependencies: ::

    # yum install -y  http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
    # yum install -y gcc gcc-c++ mysql-server mysql-devel openjdk-1.7.0

After that, enable the goldstone repository: ::

    # yum install -y http://repo.solinea.com/repo/goldstone_repos-1.1-1.noarch.rpm

Finally, install the goldstone application: ::

    # yum install -y goldstone

This package installation may take up to 2 hours to run, as it needs to compile a number of libraries.

Once the goldstone rpm is installed, edit the ``/opt/goldstone/goldstone/settings/production.py`` file to add your OpenStack admin credentials. These are located at the bottom of the file: ::

    OS_USERNAME = 'admin'
    OS_PASSWORD = 'fe6ac09d85041ae384c66a83e362f565'
    OS_TENANT_NAME = 'admin'
    OS_AUTH_URL = 'http://10.10.15.230:5000/v2.0'

DIRECT LOGS TO GOLDSTONE SERVER
*******************************

With goldstone installed, the only task left is to point the OpenStack server logs to it so that it can begin processing them. There are two tasks in this step:

    1. Configure OpenStack services to use syslog
    2. Configure syslog to forward to your goldstone server

OpenStack Service Logging
---------------------------

Each OpenStack service uses one of the local syslog facilities to help with categorization of logs.  There are generally three fields to set in the configuration file for a service (i.e. ``/etc/nova/nova.conf``).  They are:

* ``verbose = True``
* ``use_syslog = True``
* ``syslog_log_facility = LOG_LOCAL{X}``

Swift has a different configuration mechanism, so inserting the following entries in swift.conf will configure the logging properly: ::

    [object-server]
    set log_facility = LOG_LOCAL4
    set log_level = INFO

    [object-replicator]
    set log_facility = LOG_LOCAL4
    set log_level = INFO

    [object-updater]
    set log_facility = LOG_LOCAL4
    set log_level = INFO

    [object-auditor]
    set log_facility = LOG_LOCAL4
    set log_level = INFO

The following service mapping is used for syslog_log_facility:

* nova => LOG_LOCAL0
* glance => LOG_LOCAL1
* neutron => LOG_LOCAL2
* ceilometer => LOG_LOCAL3
* swift => LOG_LOCAL4
* cinder => LOG_LOCAL5
* keystone => LOG_LOCAL6


Rsyslog Forwarding
-------------------

In the ``/opt/goldstone/external`` folder, there are example configuration files for rsyslog:

* ``/opt/goldstone/external/rsyslog/rsyslog.conf`` is an example main rsyslog configuration file. It references the goldstone specific file below.
* ``/opt/goldstone/external/rsyslog/rsyslog.d/10-goldstone.conf`` provides specific mapping. THIS FILE NEEDS TO BE MODIFIED to replace the '@@goldstone_ip:5514' in the local0.* to local7.* lines with your goldstone server IP address or name. For example, if your goldstone server's IP address 10.10.10.1, then your file should be edited to read: ::

        local0.*    @@10.10.10.1:5514    # nova
        local1.*    @@10.10.10.1:5514    # glance
        local2.*    @@10.10.10.1:5514    # neutron
        local3.*    @@10.10.10.1:5514    # ceilometer
        local4.*    @@10.10.10.1:5514    # swift
        local5.*    @@10.10.10.1:5514    # cinder
        local6.*    @@10.10.10.1:5514    # keystone
        local7.*    @@10.10.10.1:5514    # other 

Restart the OpenStack services and syslog or reboot the node. Repeat this on all the OpenStack servers (or better include this in your puppet scripts).

FINISHED !
*********************

Now that everything has been configured, point your browser to the goldstone server IP address or name and begin using goldstone.
