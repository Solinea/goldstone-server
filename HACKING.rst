GOLDSTONE HACKING GUIDE
========================

Initial Setup
*************

If you're doing this on OS X, you need to install these packages::

    (Install Homebrew, per the instructions at http://brew.sh.)

    $ brew upgrade
    $ brew doctor            # Resolve any any errors or warnings before continuing.

    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
    $ brew cask install java
    $ brew install python    # This puts a Python interpreter where mkvirtualenv expects to find it.
    
Create your virtual environment for goldstone. Virtualenvwrapper makes this easy
(see http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html)::

    $ pip install virtualenvwrapper
    $ pip install tox

Add the following or similar to your .bash_profile::

    export ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future # for Mavericks
    export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home)"
    export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python
    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
    export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/devel
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

Create the virtual environment (this will also install virtualenv)::

    $ mkvirtualenv goldstone

Customize your virtualenv postactive script to make it yours. This is a suggested virtualenv/postactivate.

  .. code:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    cd ~/devel/goldstone
    export GOLDSTONE_SECRET="%ic+ao@5xani9s*%o355gv1%!)v1qh-43g24wt9l)gr@mx9#!7"

    # For example, export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=goldstone.settings.local_oak_c2
    export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=goldstone.settings.local_<datacenter>_<cloud_instance>

    redis-server > /dev/null 2>&1 &
    elasticsearch > /dev/null 2>&1 &
    postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres &



This is a suggested virtualenv/deactivate:

  .. code:: bash

    #!/bin/bash

    echo "shutting down redis"
    pkill -f redis

    echo "shutting down elasticsearch"
    pkill -f elasticsearch

    echo "shutting down postgres"
    pkill -f postgres

Activating and deactivating the environment can be done with the following commands::

    $ workon goldstone
    $ deactivate

Install these packages locally::

    $ workon goldstone
    $ brew install elasticsearch
    $ brew install phantomjs
    $ brew install redis
    $ brew install postgresql

Create development and test databases. Create a user goldstone with the role goldstone
(or edit your development.py setttings file)::
    
    $ createdb goldstone_dev
    $ createdb goldstone_test
    $ createdb goldstone
    $ createuser goldstone -d
  
Edit your pg_hba.conf file.  If you installed with brew, this should be in 
    ``/usr/local/var/postgres/``.  See INSTALL for the modifications.::

    $ pg_ctl reload
   
Clone Goldstone from the bitbucket repo::

    $ cd $PROJECT_HOME
    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:solinea/goldstone.git

Now, install pip prerequesites. These let your run the application on your laptop::

    $ workon goldstone
    $ cd goldstone                    # If your postactive script doesn't have a cd
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -r test-requirements.txt

Open a VPN connection to the development Oakland (oak) cloud.

Sync and migrate the databases. Note, you'll need to do this for the goldstone_dev, goldstone_test, and goldstone databases,
whichever one you use. A simple test is, if you change the value of DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE, you'll need to re-issue these
commands::

    $ fab syncmigrate

Create the default user and tenant::

    $ fab tenant_init

Set up the elasticsearch templates for test running (repeat with other settings as required)::

    $ fab load

Now test out the server::

    $ fab runserver

You should now see the application running at http://localhost:8000/


Goldstone Testing
*****************

Goldstone uses the standard Django testing tools:

* Tox for test automation. Goldstone's tox setup tests against Python 2.6, Python 2.7 and PEP8 (syntax) by default. Additional jobs for coverage and pyflakes are available.
* Django TestCase and selenium are used for unit and functional testing respectively.

Goldstone strives for 100% code coverage. Code coverage reports can be created through the `tox -e cover` command::

    $ tox -e cover
    GLOB sdist-make: /Users/kpepple/Documents/dev/Solinea/goldstone-ui/setup.py
    cover inst-nodeps: /Users/kpepple/Documents/dev/Solinea/goldstone-ui/.tox/dist/goldstone-ui-2014.1.dev56.g0558e73.zip

Front-end testing
*****************

This information assumes you already have node/npm installed.
It also assumes you already have phantomjs installed via previous steps in the HACKING.rst file.
If not, install it via homebrew. At the time of this documentation, the testing environment was compatible with phantomjs 1.9.7

$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install
$ grunt
This will kick off the preliminary lint/test/watch routine.

In order for the e2e tests to run, you MUST have the server running and access to live data.

At the time of this documentation, the Gruntfile.js is configured with the following combo tasks:
grunt (default task): lint / test / watch.
grunt watch: watch for changes that will trigger unit/integration/e2e tests
grunt lint: lint only (no watch).
grunt test: unit/integration/e2e test only (no watch).
grunt lintAndTest: lint and test only (no watch).
grunt testDev: lint, followed by unit/integration test (no e2e) and watch that only triggers further unit/integration tests, no e2e tests.



Documentation
=============

To create the product documentation:

* cd to doc directory - $ cd doc
* install sphinx - $ sudo pip install sphinx
* make the documentation - $ make html

The documentation will be in the doc/build/html directory

Creating Release
****************

To create a release, follow these steps:

# Bump the version number in the setup.cfg file (if not done already)
# Tag and sign the commit ($ git tag -s 1.0 -m 'first customer ship') -- PBR requires SIGNED tags to correctly build the version number into the RPM.
# Push the tags to bitbucket ($ git push origin 1.0)
# Create the RPM (on CentOS/Red Hat machine with # python setup.py bdist_rpm)
# SCP the RPM to the repo (# scp dist/goldstone-1.0-1.noarch.rpm repo.solinea.com:/var/www/html/repo/)
# Update the repo (on repo.solinea.com, run # createrepo /var/www/html/repo/)
# Have a drink at Eureka and wait for the bitching


Major Design Decisions
**********************

* Goldstone is currently based on the 1.6 version of `Django`_.
* For database and model migrations, Goldstone uses `South`_.
* Goldstone has chosen Postgresql as its main database, however MySQL will also be tested against.
* The PBR library (created by the OpenStack project) is used for sane and simple setup.py, versioning and setup.cfg values.
* `Celery`_ and django-celery is used for asyncronous tasks.
* Goldstone has additional developer tasks augemented by the django_extensions library.
* The `Twitter Bootstrap 3`_ framework is used for UX. This also means that `jQuery`_ and `jQuery-UI`_ are used in the UX. `Font Awesome`_ has been used for icons instead of the standard icons.

GoldStone Style Commandments
****************************

In general, we follow the `OpenStack style conventions`_ where they are possible and applicable.
