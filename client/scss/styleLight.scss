styleDark.scss and styleLight.scss exist as targets for a Grunt watch task
that is scanning for changes in the scss directory. When it finds them,
it will run a scss -> css routine that will reference both the dark and light
files, and output two different css files that are switchable via the
Goldstone user settings interface.
