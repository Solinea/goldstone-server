# since the gelf logger (at least in python) adds the @timestamp field,
# we need to add our own timestamp to ensure that our alerting system
# has the best chance of not dropping things on the floor.  If it were
# based on the timestamp, delays in arrival to logstash could mess 
# with our walk-forward time windowing. We are still succeptible to
# delays between logstash and ES, but that's much less likely than
# delays from the source host to ES via logstash.
