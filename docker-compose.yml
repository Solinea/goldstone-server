# This script starts the boot2docker and OpenStack VirtualBox VMs, then
# brings up the docker containers that support Goldstone.  It is known
# to work with VirtualBox 4.3.30 or greater, and boot2docker v1.6.2.
#
# It assumes that you are running in a virtualenv, and that you have cloned
# the goldstone-docker and goldstone-server Github repos into the
# PROJECT_HOME associated with the virtual environment.
#
# Caution should be taken to ensure that the OpenStack VM is not in the
# process of shutting down when this script is executed, otherwise you
# may end up with a successful run, but the VM will be down.  If you use
# the sibling stop_dev_env.sh script to shut down, the condition will be
# rare since the script waits until the VM is powered off before exiting.
