to invoke:
1. include infoButonText.js in the template script tags
2. instantiate the model as a variable: var infoButtonText = new InfoButtonText().get('infoText');
3. invoke via infoButtonText, and an index corresponding to the particular text desired.

2 styles:
---------
1. infoButtonText.discoverCloudTopology (Front Page Cloud Topology)
2. infoButtonText['eventTimeline'] (Front Page Event Timeline)
