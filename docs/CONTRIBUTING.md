# Contributing to Goldstone

We welcome community participation, and will be working on some contributor guidelines in the near
future. In the mean time, take a look at the [HACKING](https://github.com/Solinea/goldstone-server/tree/master/docs/HACKING.md)
guide, and let us know if you have questions about the development environment or processes.
