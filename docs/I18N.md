### This document assumes you have installed Goldstone according to the HACKING.md document, and have node/npm installed.

Make sure your dev environment is up to date with the latest npm dependencies with:

`$ npm install`

#### Please keep in mind that there is no direct relationship between .po files, and JavaScript. So in order for changes or additional to the .po files in `goldstone/static/i18n/po_files` to have an effect on the client rendering, you have to make sure that modifications are made with the Grunt.js task runner operating by running `grunt watch` in a terminal tab.

## How i18n is implented for the client in Goldstone.

The Goldstone i18n scheme is based on the gettext standard, which is a very old standard, with which many translators are already familiar. There are multiple tools and libraries available so that the same .po files can be applied to client and server environments. Goldstone uses a popular library, **[Jed.js](https://github.com/SlexAxton/Jed)**, to make availabl the gettext functions. And to make the .po files readable by Jed.js, we chose the recommended adjunct library, po2json which makes for a Jed-readable json object.

With the `grunt watch` environment running, any additions of new .po files, or modification of existing .po files will trigger a Grunt task called **po2json** that will create a new json object that will be served by django, and made available to the JavaScript client.

With each browser page refresh, the client initialization process includes parsing the transated i18n json object, and making it readible by the Jed.js library that adapts the standard gettext functions for JavaScript.

## How to import a new .po file into the front-end i18n scheme so it's available as a selection in the client.

When adding a new .po file, keep in mind that the actual name of the file prior to the `.po` (eg: _English_ from **English.po**) is what will be used to dynamically populate the choice of languages that can be selected in the client via the settings page. Capitilization will be carried over, so be sure to name your .po file exactly as you'd like it applied as a language choice.

Adding a file to or changing a file in `goldstone/static/i18n/po_files` with the `grunt watch` task runnign will trigger a re-rendering of `goldstone/static/i18n/po_json/i18n_combined.json`. This file is used to by the Jed.js library as described in the section above.

The gettext functions that have been wrapped in the goldstone namespace at this time are:

* dgettext (translate a string in the context of a particular domain)
* dpgettext (translate a string in the context of a particular domain, with an additional context specifier)

Additional getttext functions are available as part of:
`goldstone.translationObject`

For example, if you had a particular need to implement a lookup with dnpgettext (domain, number, plural), you could do so with
`goldstone.translationObject.dnpgettext(domain, context, singular_eky, plural_key, value)`.

The full range of combos, as documented by Jed.js, is as follows:

```
gettext = function ( key )
dgettext = function ( domain, key )
dcgettext = function ( domain, key, category )
ngettext = function ( singular_key, plural_key, value )
dngettext = function ( domain, singular_ley, plural_key, value )
dcngettext = function ( domain, singular_key, plural_key, value, category )
pgettext = function ( context, key )
dpgettext = function ( domain, context, key )
npgettext = function ( context, singular_key, plural_key, value )
dnpgettext = function ( domain, context, singular_key, plural_key, value )
dcnpgettext = function ( domain, context, singular_key, plural_key, value, category )
```
