# Goldstone Server Release Notes

This page documents core features included in the Goldstone Server and Goldstone Server Enterprise release. For detailed information on using any of Goldstone Serverâ€™s features, please refer to the User Guide.

## 1.1.0

### Requirements

* Adds integration with RedHat RDO Liberty with EPEL enabled

Due to a bug in RDO Liberty, a manual patch is required to successfully manage this distribution.  This bug does not affect RDO Kilo.  The bug is documented here: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1282093]. The bug has been fixed in the community version of OpenStack, and during testing of Goldstone Server, the patch released by the community has been manually applied to RDO Liberty deployments successfully.
